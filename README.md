# Drowsiness-Detection-System
This is a system used to detect drowsiness of the driver when he/she appears to be drowsy. The system constantly monitors the eye and mouth region to check whether the driver's eyes are drowsy or if hs/she is yawning. If the driver's eye's are drowsy an alarm is triggered to alert the driver. This could potentially decrease the accidents that occur due to drowsiness.
