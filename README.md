# Drowsiness-Detection-System
This is a system used to detect drowsiness of the driver when he/she appears to be drowsy. The system constantly monitors the eye and mouth region to check whether the driver's eyes are drowsy or if hs/she is yawning. If the driver's eye's are drowsy an alarm is triggered to alert the driver. This could potentially decrease the accidents that occur due to drowsiness. 
# Why this particular topic was chosen?
More than 6,000 people die in drowsy driving-related crashes in the US alone each year, a recent study suggests. Millions of drivers fall asleep at the wheel each month, and roughly 15 percent of all fatal crashes involve a drowsy driver. Drowsiness detection helps to avoid crashes caused by fatigue by advising drivers to take a break in time.
# Objective and Scope
Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps to save the life of the driver by preventing accidents when the driver is getting drowsy. The main objective is to first design a system to detect driverâ€™s drowsiness by continuously monitoring the drivers eyes. The system works in various lighting conditions and alerts the driver on the detection of drowsiness by using buzzer or alarm.
